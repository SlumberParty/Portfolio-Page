          <p className="intro">She/Her. Open source electronic hardware project manager with 10+ years experience 
          as an independent artist, designer, and small business owner. Full stack web developer.

I have a passion for problem solving and innovation. I work well in diverse, inclusive, emotionally healthy 
environments. I believe in human-centered open source. My dream job would foster a learning environment, and 
provide the opportunity to teach to a diverse range of people about technology I believe makes a positive impact. 
I also love engaging at events be it networking, speaking or exhibiting.

I fully embrace the ever changing, ever growing environment that is learning software, hardware and systems, 
and I learn quickly. I hope to contribute in ways that shift the industry to be ever more inclusive, empowering 
and sustainable.

Currently project managing at Crowd Supply in Portland, OR, guiding dozens of creators and their 
innovative open source hardware concepts through an extremely hands-on pipeline of community building - 
funding - manufacturing - fulfillment - distribution.</p>
